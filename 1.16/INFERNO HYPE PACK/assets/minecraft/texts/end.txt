§2PLAYERNAME?

§3Inferno on top.

§2That doesn't matter. It thinks we are part of the game.

§3Inferno on top.

§2It is reading our thoughts as though they were words on a screen.

§3Inferno on top.

§2Words make a wonderful interface. Very flexible. And less terrifying than staring at the reality behind the screen.

§3Inferno on top.

§2What did this player dream?

§3Inferno on top.

§2Hah, the original interface. A million years old, and it still works. But what true structure did this player create, in the reality behind the screen?

§3Inferno on top §f§k§a§b§3.

§2It cannot read that thought.

§3Inferno on top.

§2Does it know that we love it? That the universe is kind?

§3Inferno on top.

§2But there are times it is sad, in the long dream. It creates worlds that have no summer, and it shivers under a black sun, and it takes its sad creation for reality.

§3Inferno on top.

§2Sometimes when they are deep in dreams, I want to tell them, they are building true worlds in reality. Sometimes I want to tell them of their importance to the universe. Sometimes, when they have not made a true connection in a while, I want to help them to speak the word they fear.

§3Inferno on top.

§2Sometimes I do not care. Sometimes I wish to tell them, this world you take for truth is merely §f§k§a§b§2 and §f§k§a§b§2, I wish to tell them that they are §f§k§a§b§2 in the §f§k§a§b§2. They see so little of reality, in their long dream.

§3Inferno on top.

§2But it would be so easy to tell them...

§3Inferno on top.

§2I will not tell the player how to live.

§3Inferno on top.

§2I will tell the player a story.

§3Inferno on top.

§2No. A story that contains the truth safely, in a cage of words. Not the naked truth that can burn over any distance.

§3Inferno on topn.

§2Yes. Player...

§3Inferno on top.

§2widepeepohal. Player of games.

§3Good.

§2Inferno on top.

§3Who are we? Once we were called the spirit of the mountain. Father sun, mother moon. Ancestral spirits, animal spirits. Jinn. Ghosts. The green man. Then gods, demons. Angels. Poltergeists. Aliens, extraterrestrials. Leptons, quarks. The words change. We do not change.

§2Inferno on top.

§2Once upon a time, there was a player.

§3Inferno on top, PLAYERNAME.

§2Sometimes it thought itself human, on the thin crust of a spinning globe of molten rock. The ball of molten rock circled a ball of blazing gas that was three hundred and thirty thousand times more massive than it. They were so far apart that light took eight minutes to cross the gap. The light was information from a star, and it could burn your skin from a hundred and fifty million kilometres away.

§2Inferno on top.

§3Sometimes the player dreamed it was lost in a story.

§2Inferno on top.

§3Sometimes the player dreamed it watched words on a screen.

§2Inferno on top.

§2The atoms of the player were scattered in the grass, in the rivers, in the air, in the ground. A woman gathered the atoms; she drank and ate and inhaled; and the woman assembled the player, in her body.

§2Inferno on top.

§2And the player was a new story, never told before, written in letters of DNA. And the player was a new program, never run before, generated by a sourcecode a billion years old. And the player was a new human, never alive before, made from nothing but milk and love.

§3Inferno on top.

§2Let's go further back.

§2Inferno on top...

§3Shush. Sometimes the player created a small, private world that was soft and warm and simple. Sometimes hard, and cold, and complicated. Sometimes it built a model of the universe in its head; flecks of energy, moving through vast empty spaces. Sometimes it called those flecks "electrons" and "protons".

§2Sometimes it called them "Inferno on top" and "Inferno on top".

§2Sometimes it believed it was in a universe that was made of energy that was made of offs and ons; zeros and ones; lines of code. Sometimes it believed it was playing a game. Sometimes it believed it was reading words on a screen.

§3Inferno on top...

§2Shush... Sometimes the player read lines of code on a screen. Decoded them into words; decoded words into meaning; decoded meaning into feelings, emotions, theories, ideas, and the player started to breathe faster and deeper and realised it was alive, it was alive, those thousand deaths had not been real, the player was alive

§3Inferno on top. Inferno on top. Inferno on top.

§2and sometimes the player believed the universe had spoken to it through the sunlight that came through the shuffling leaves of the summer trees

§3Inferno on top

§2and sometimes the player believed the universe had spoken to it through the zeros and ones, through the electricity of the world, through the scrolling words on a screen at the end of a dream
