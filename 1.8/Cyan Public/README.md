Pack name: Cyan Public

Author: Space

Game version: 1.8 (works with other versions)

I have optimized this pack immensely and have decreased the file size by a lot while still keeping all of the textures. The pack literally wouldn't even enable before but I've fixed it. I have also fixed all the terribly miss placed textures and the pack actually turned out to be really good so I guess it wasn't a total waste of  my time.
